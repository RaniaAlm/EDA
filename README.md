# EDA (Exploratory data analysis)

### Goal :

The Moburst project's goal is to use the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) turnstile data to recommend where to place its animated billboards at the three most frequented stations, in order to attract the greatest number of entrants to the station to advertisements. In addition, the company is interested in determining the total entries for each day of the week to set the price of the advertisements. So an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was undertaken, and a plethora of plots to visualize and communicate the obtained findings were generated.

### Question :

- Will the EDA assists Moburst Advertising in reaching its goal? 

### Data Description :

To fulfill the project goal, I will analyze the MTA data , namely the following features (C/A, UNIT, SCP, STATION, DATE, TIME, ENTRIES) . Additionally, I will obtain MTA data via the MTA website. I will use data from July 03, 2021 to October 02, 2021, totaling 2934629 observations.

### Tools :

* Jupyter & Python.
* SQLite & SQLAlchemy for data storing and retrieving . 
* Pandas & Numpy  for data manipulation.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting.
